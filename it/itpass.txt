ITPASS is a program for InstantTrack users that predicts satellite passes.
It fills two needs:

	1. Station automation software (like for a PacSat gateway)
	   can run ITPASS to determine what satellite will be
           available at what time, for scheduling purposes.

	2. Satellite users can get a quick summary of what satellites
	   will be available when, without running InstantTrack.

ITPASS is controlled from the DOS command line.  It doesn't have any
fancy screen displays like InstantTrack does.  If you run ITPASS
without any arguments (that is, you just type "ITPASS" at the DOS
command prompt) it gives you a little summary of the options you
can type on the ITPASS command line.

You can control the following things:

	1. What satellites ITPASS reports on,
	2. What station QTH ITPASS reports for,
	3. How many times ITPASS reports on each satellite,
	4. What date and time ITPASS calculates from, and
	5. What output format ITPASS uses.
	6. How long a pass must be for ITPASS to report it.
        7. How high above the horizon a pass must be.
        8. How far into the future ITPASS should search for the next pass.

I'll tell you about how to control each of those things in the next
few paragraphs.

Which Satellites
================
ITPASS finds information about satellites in InstantTrack's
satellites database file, IT.ORB.  This file is found using the same
rules InstantTrack uses (see ITMANUAL.TXT for details).
There is no way to run ITPASS on a satellite that is not in InstantTrack's
database.

There are two ways to select satellites:
	1. Give their names on the command line, or
	2. Specify a group name on the command line.

To select satellites by name, just mention them on the command line.
Example:

	ITPASS AO-16

will display the AOS and LOS times of the next AO-16 pass.  You can
mention several satellites at once if you like.  Example:

	ITPASS AO-16 DO-17 WO-18 LO-19

ITPASS will report the AOS and LOS times of the next pass for each
satellite you mention.  If the satellite name contains a space, you
must enclose the satellite name in quotation marks.  Example:

	ITPASS "SPOT 1" "SPOT 2"

If you use any of the command flags (which all begin with "-") you
must put them BEFORE any satellites you name.


To select satellites by group, put "-g" on the command line and
follow it with one or more letters specifying which group or groups
you are interested in.  Example:

	ITPASS -g a

asks ITPASS to report on every satellite in group "a".

	ITPASS -g ar

asks ITPASS to report on every satellite in group "a" or group "r". 
If the satellite is in both groups, it will only be reported once.
Satellites found by group will always be reported on in the order
they appear in the InstantTrack database.

You can use both methods.  Remember to put the group flag ("-g xxx")
before the satellite name(s).  The satellite(s) you mention
specifically will be reported on first, then the ones in the group(s)
you specify.  If a satellite you mention specifically is also in a
group, it will be reported on twice.  Example:

	ITPASS -g a Mir

will report on Mir and all satellites in group "a".


What Station
============
ITPASS finds information about station locations in InstantTrack's
station database file, IT.QTH.  This file is found using the same
rules InstantTrack uses (see ITMANUAL.TXT for details). There is
no way to run ITPASS for a station location that is not in
InstantTrack's database.

By default, ITPASS will use the first station in the InstantTrack
station database.  This station is normally set to your home QTH.  If
you wish to run ITPASS for some other QTH (for instance, to check for
mutual windows) you can specify a station name by using the "-s"
flag.  Example:

	ITPASS -s KB5MU ao-13

will report AOS and LOS times for the next AO-13 pass at my QTH.

If the station name contains a space, you must enclose the station
name in quotation marks.  Example:

	ITPASS -s "New York" ao-13

How Many Times
==============
If you are interested in more than just the next pass, you can ask
ITPASS to report on more passes by using the "-n" flag.  Example:

	ITPASS -n 5 ao-13

will report AOS and LOS times for the next five passes of AO-13.


If you use the "-n" flag with multiple satellites, ITPASS will report
on each satellite the number of times you specify, then leave a blank
line, then go on to the next satellite.


What Date and Time
==================
There is a way to control the time from which ITPASS computes the
satellite passes.  However, you will not find it very useful for
interactive use.  It is intended primarily for use by programs that
are trying to schedule satellite passes.  The time is specified as a
floating point modified Julian date, in days, with the "-t" flag.
Example:

	ITPASS -t 47941.21243125 lo-19

means report passes starting from the modified Julian date
47941.21243125, which is approximately 19 Feb 90 at 05:05Z.


What Output Format
==================
ITPASS supports two different output formats.  One is designed to be
easy for humans to read, and the other is designed to be easy for
computers to read.  The human-readable format looks like this:

    Satellite         AOS Time (UTC)      LOS Time (UTC)    Max El
==================  ==================  ==================  ======
ao-16                5 Mar 93 07:06:54   5 Mar 93 07:21:28    37ø

Date/times are shown in DD MMM YY HH:MM:SS format.  If the satellite
is already in view at the time you run ITPASS (or the time you
specify with the "-t" flag) it will say "Up now!" instead of the AOS
time.  If the satellite won't rise or set during the next two days
(or the number of days you set with the "-o" flag, see below) from
that time, a message to that effect will replace both AOS and LOS
times.  The Max El column shows the maximum elevation angle during
the pass, in degrees.  You get this format by default.

You can make it output the date/time values in your local time zone,
if ITPASS can determine your local time zone. ITPASS uses the same
procedures as InstantTrack to determine time zone. See ITMANUAL.TXT
for details. ITPASS honors the "timezone" and "timezone_offset_seconds"
variables in the IT.INI configuration file. If it can't find that file
or if those variables are not set, it checks the DOS environment
variable TZ.

To see times displayed in your local time zone, just use the "-z" flag.
Example:

	ITPASS -z uo-14


To get the computer-readable format, just put "-d" on the command
line.  Example:

	ITPASS -d ao-13

The computer-readable format looks like this:

ao-16                49051.29646478 49051.30658757 37

(sat name)           (aos time)     (los time)     (maximum elevation)
Date/times are shown as floating point modified Julian dates, in days.
The maximum elevation is in degrees.

If the satellite is already in view, the AOS time will be reported as
the present (or reference) time.  If the satellite is not in view and
will not be in view during the next two days (or the number of days you
set with the "-o" flag, see below), the AOS time and LOS times are
reported as 999999, and the maximum elevation is reporte as -1.  If
the satellite is in view and will remain in view for the next two days
(or the number of days you set with the "-o" flag, see below), the AOS
time will be reported as the present (or reference) time, and the LOS
time will be reported as 999999, and the maximum elevation is reported
as -1.  The satellites are not separated by a blank line in the
computer-readable mode, nor are any headers or banners output.

If an error occurs, the AOS and LOS times will be replaced by an
error message.  So, a program that reads this format should be
prepared to deal with lines that don't parse as shown above.

Minimum Pass Duration
=====================
If you're only interested in passes longer than a certain minimum
duration, you can tell ITPASS to ignore shorter passes.  Use the
-L flag and specify how many minutes the pass must last.  Example:

	ITPASS -L 10 AO-16

will report the next pass that's at least 10 minutes long.

Minimum Pass Elevation
======================
If you're only interested in passes that reach a certain minimum
elevation angle above the horizon, you can tell ITPASS to ignore
lower passes.  Use the -E flag and specify the minimum elevation
angle, in degrees, that you want to see.  Example:

        ITPASS -E 10 AO-16

will report the next pass that reaches a maximum elevation angle
above 10 degrees.  Note that the AOS and LOS times reported are
still relative to a 0ø horizon.

Maximum Forward Search Time
===========================
By default, ITPASS will search forward 48 hours (two days) for
the next pass. In most cases, that will be sufficient for any
satellite. If the satellite is in a near-equatorial orbit and
the ground station is at a high latitude (North or South) this
limit may need to be increased. Use the -o flag and specify the
new limit, in days. Example:

        ITPASS -o 10 SO-33
        
will search forward ten days each time it looks for a pass.

Mixing Options
==============
You can use more than one option at the same time.  Example:

        ITPASS -g a -s "New York" -n 5 -z -L 4 -e 7 -o 10 Mir

will report on Mir and satellites in the "a" group, relative to
the station New York, listing five passes each of which must be
at least four minutes in duration and reach an elevation angle
of seven degrees, searching forward up to ten days for each pass,
and report in local time.  Whew!

=======================================================================
OS/2 Version

ITPASS has been ported to an OS/2 native version, but since OS/2 usage
has fallen to nearly zero, I don't intend to release or maintain that
version. If you have a need for the OS/2 version, please let me know.


=======================================================================

Source Code
===========
I generally release source code for my programs.  However, ITPASS
contains proprietary InstantTrack code, and source code for
InstantTrack is not freely available.  So, I must also control the
source to ITPASS.  If you really need access to source code, contact
me about the possibility of a source code license.

ITPASS is written entirely in C.  I used the Microsoft 6.00A compiler
under DOS, and formerly the IBM C/Set++ 2.1 compiler for OS/2.

Most of the math routines used in ITPASS were lifted directly from
InstantTrack.
