<p>The Delfi-Next mission (also written as Delfi-n3Xt) is second in a development line of nanosatellites called the ?Delfi Program? and is successor to the successful Delfi-C3 mission.</p>
<p>The mission statement for Delfi-Next is as follows: ?Delfi-Next shall be a reliable triple-unit CubeSat of TU Delft which implements substantial advances in 1 subsystem with respect to Delfi-C3 and allows technology demonstration of 2 payloads from external partners from 2012 onwards?.</p> 
<p>The Delfi-Next mission is further specified according to the three general objectives of the Delfi program.</p>
<p>Educational objective: The Delfi program shall provide students optimal preparation for careers in space industry. This preparation includes improvement of skills in systems engineering, teamwork, scientific writing, and communication and facilitates hands-on experience with all aspects of the development of a (small) spacecraft.</p>
<p>Technology demonstration objective: For Delfi-Next, the two payloads onboard are a micro-propulsion system developed by TNO in cooperation with TU Delft and University of Twente called T3uPS and an in-orbit configurable, high-efficient transceiver platform developed by ISIS BV, in cooperation with TU Delft and SystematIC BV called ITRX. Delfi-Next will carry out an onboard experiment on hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cells from the micro-electronics institute DIMES from the TU Delft. Additionally, an experimental very low frequency receiver might be tested as precursor for the OLFAR program.</p>
<p>Nanosatellite bus development objective: The mission clearly states that one subsystem should be significantly advanced compared to Delfi-C3. The attitude control system plays an important role in more advanced capabilities for nanosatellites. With full three-axis active control, sun-pointing a solar array could yield more specific power, ground station tracking could be used for higher data-rates, instrument pointing can be used for remote sensing and formation flying is possible if attitude and orbit can be (relatively) controlled. Delfi-C3 is equipped with a passive magnetic attitude control, which is unsuitable for such functionalities. As such, it is decided that Delfi-Next will be significantly advanced in the Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem compared to Delfi-C3.</p>
<p>T3 uPS Micro propulsion Payload: Cold gas propulsion is the simplest configuration, requiring the least components.In a controlled manner gas is released from a tank by a valve and expelled through the thruster. Such a cold gas blow-down rocket engine typically consists of a gas tank, a pressure and temperature sensor, an on/off valve and a thruster. The micro propulsion payload has a possible application for formation flying with CubeSats. It is a Cold Gas Generator technology which is save upon launch and has a variable trust between 0 ? 6 mN.</p>
<p>Telemetry: Where Delfi-C3 is using rascal as telemetry software, Delfi-n3xt has a new version that is called DUDe. The software will be available in the next couple of weeks. Ground stations that are using rascal will have to request a new user account when they want to automatically upload there received telemetry. One other thing that is changed, the downlink data rate is 2400 baud bpsk.</p>
<p>Status: Delfi-n3Xt was launched with the Russian Dnepr on November 2013 from Yasny launch site.</p>
