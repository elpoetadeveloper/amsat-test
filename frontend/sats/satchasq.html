<p>The Chasqui-1 amateur radio satellite has been successfully deployed from the International Space Station during a spacewalk by two Russian Cosmonauts.</p>
<p>It is a research satellite designed to standard CubeSat dimension by the Peruvian National University of Engineering in collaboration with the Southwest State University in Kursk.</p>
<p>Experiments onboard include cameras that work by visible and infrared light.</p>
<p>It carries a beacon on 437.025MHz that can transmit either 1200 bit per second audio frequency shift keying using AX.25 protocol or 9600 bits per second Gaussian minimum shift keying, better known as GMSK.
<p>The "Chasqui I Research Nanosatellite" project is the first satellite project of Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería (National University of Engineering" and its main goal is improving UNI's satellite technology - related capacities, through the design, analysis, assembly, integration, testing and operation of a small dimension satellite. Furthermore, the satellite is intended to take pictures of the Earth and transmit them to the ground station.</p>
<p>We are talking about a 10x10x10 cm3 satellite with a weight of around 1 Kg. It has two cameras, one in the visible range and one in the infra-red range.</p> 
<p>Also, it includes its own attitude control and determination system, communication in the amateur radio band mechanisms, as well as power and thermal control mechanisms based on solar cells of high eficiency and an embedded control and information management system for all the components of the satellite.</p>
<p>The "Chasqui I" is an unprecedented effort to provide our country access to space for the first time and gives us the opportunity to open new application areas specific to our own geographical and social reality.</p> 
<p>It is also from an academic point of view a tool that facilitates collaboration between the various faculties and research institutes of the University, trains students and teachers with real world experience in satellite building, creates opportunities for joint work with several universities in the world and allows technological advances in the aerospace industry in our country.</p>
<p>To develop small-scale satellites like Chasqui I gives way to various possibilities of access to space with lower costs and development time. For this reason, various universities, companies and government organizations around the world show interest in developing small satellites that can carry out experiments and scientific missions that are not easily accessible through conventional satellites.</p>
<p>The educational and technological benefits of the project can be emphasized in the field training of engineers and scientists in the near future and the maturation of this technology coupled with the implementation of a network of this type of satellites that will allow to generate new low-cost applications in the field of telecommunications, Earth observation and exploration of natural resources, all of great importance to the development of our country.</p>
