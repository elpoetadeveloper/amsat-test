<p>Freeman, N5FPP, reports:<br>
Tonight's passes of RS-15 started out with a strong beacon transmitting telemetry at 0400, by the 0605 pass over North America the beacon had degraded
to a continuous carrier lasting upwards to 30 seconds.  The frequency shifted
up and down quite a bit as you listen to it.  On the 0605 pass once RS-15 went
into eclipse the beacon died altogether. It's hard listening this bird die.</p>

<p>RS-15 beacon on 10 metres</p>
<p>The 10 metre beacon on the RS-15 Amateur Radio satellite is still going strong over 14 and a half years since it was launched.</p>

<p>RS-15 was launched on 26th December 1994. Its 145 to 29 MHz linear transponder has ceased operation, however, from time to time the 10 metre beacon can still be heard.</p>

<p>Most commercial low earth orbit satellites cease operating after a few years and it is a reflection on the very high standard of amateur satellite design and construction that amateur satellites such as RS-15 can last so long.</p>

</p>Henk PA3GUO has posted a 12 second MP3 of the beacon on 29.350 MHz at http://www.pa3guo.com/rs15_cw_14june2009_0820utc.mp3</p>
 
<p>Looking for more confirmations of RS-15 coming back.</p>
