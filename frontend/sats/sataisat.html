<p>AISat is technology demonstration mission of DLR (German Aerospace Center). Two institutes of DLR are involved in the development of this project: The Institute of Space Systems in Bremen developed the main body of the nanosatellite and system engineering, while the Institute of Composite Structures and Adaptive Systems in Braunschweig took the responsibility for the experimental verification of the helical antenna. Cooperating partners in the project are the University of Bremen and two industrial companies.</p>
<p>The distinctive feature of this mission, compared to AIS (Automatic Identification System) satellites already in orbit, lies in the use of a high-gain helical antenna, which enables the reception of AIS signals, especially on highly frequented sea areas, where signal collisions often lead to non-decodable data.</p>
<p>The mission objectives require an antenna with an excellent directionality, i.e. with a comparatively narrow illumination radius. Otherwise, with a too large antenna footprint the satellite would receive a huge amount of signals from a very large area. Moreover, many interfering signals which are present in adjacent frequency bands would make it almost impossible to trace individual ships.</p>
<p>High-gain helical antennas have the required directionality - and they are able to receive not only the Class A VHF signals from commercial shipping, but also Class B signals from non-commercial ships, as well as Search And Rescue (SAR) transmitter signals sent from survival craft or distressed vessels. Thus, the spiral form of the antenna was mandatory.</p>
