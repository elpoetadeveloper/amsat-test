<p>SEDSat 1 (Students for the Exploration & Development of Space - Satellite) is an american microsatellite. It was to obtain images of the Earth and distribute them through the Internet from the University of Alabama in Huntsville. It also served as a relay for amateur radio communications.</p>
<p>The 34 kg satellite was built on a 32.13 cm × 32.13 cm × 35.43 cm structure. Originally it was to be deployed via a SEDS tether system (similar to SEDS 1, 2) from the Shuttle under the name SEDS-3, but due to concerns with using the tether system with the Shuttle, the mission was first redesigned for a tetherless deployment from the Shuttle and then for a deployment from a Delta stage 2.</p>
<p>SEDSat featured following equipment:</p>
<p>Imaging camera (SEDS Earth Atmospheric and Space Imaging System [SEASIS],) Visible light camera with 10, 7 and 10 nanometer filters for measuring atmospheric extinction coefficients. Resolution was 60 m in telephoto mode and 10 kg in panorama mode.</p>
<p>Mode L (13 cm uplink, 70 cm downlink digital packet UoSat compatible)</p>
<p>Mode A (2 meter uplink, 10 meter downlink, analog SSB 70 Khz transponder)</p>
<p>SEDSat 1 was launched as a piggy back payload mounted on stage 2 of a three stage Delta-7326 launch vehicle, which sent the Deep Space 1 (DS 1) space probe into a solar orbit. SEDSat 1 suffered from problems in the power system, causing both the imaging payloads and the amateur radio transponders never becoming operational. Only some telemetry was received.</p>
<p>It was designed with a lifetime of five years, but was still semi operational in 2013.</p>
<p>The satellite is not currently available for uplink
transmissions and image and transponder recovery efforts have
been unsuccessful.</p>
