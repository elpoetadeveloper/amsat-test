<p>Yubileiny-1 (or Yubileyniy) (Jubilee), also referred to as RS-30 (Radio Sputnik-30) by the amateur community, is a Russian technology development microsatellite which was designed and built jointly by the JSC-ISS (Joint Stock Company-Information Satellite Systems), named after academician M. F. Reshetnev (formerly NPO-PM) of Zheleznogorsk, along with the Siberian State Aerospace University (SibSAU) of Krasnoyarsk to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the launch of Sputnik-1 (launch Oct. 4, 1957), the first artificial satellite to be placed into Earth orbit.
<p>The objectives of the educational mission are:</p>
<p>The satellite will broadcast audio and video about the history of the Soviet and Russian space programs, as well as signals imitating those broadcast by Sputnik in 1957 (voice messages, SSTV slides, signal imitation of the first artificial Earth satellite)</p>
<li>It will help to establish conditions under which the Russian universities could study the data transmitted by the small satellite</li>
<li>It will help to carry out science and technology experiments: Prospective sun and Earth sensors flight proficiency; receiving data related to the Earth's planetary emission within infrared wavelength band; study of spatio-temporal emissions of the Earth atmosphere day and night radiation within visible spectral range.</li>
<p>Background: In December 2004, the Russian Federal Space Agency (FSA, Roskosmos), Space Forces of Ministry of Defense and Army, Air Force and Navy assistance society (AAN AS) came to the decision to create a jubilee radio amateur satellite and launch it in 2007 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the space era. The aerospace vehicle laboratory (Russia, Kaluga) was entrusted with creation of the satellite.</p>
<p>Russian space companies and organizations contributed a lot to creation of the Yubileiny spacecraft. In particular, the NPP Geofizika-Cosmos company created the satellite's sun and Earth sensors, the Saturn Company developed and built the solar arrays, Lavochkin NPO provided the gallium arsenide cells, the Ramensk instrument building company created a small magnetometer MA-6. SibSAU (Siberian State Aerospace University) research workers and students developed RADEK - devices covered with recently developed nano-coatings to protect the spacecraft electronic components against radiation impact.</p>
<p>The spacecraft structure features a hexagonal frame (bus, instrument module) consisting of three lateral webs (or trays): top, bottom and central trays. The outer panels of the bus are covered with surface-mounted solar cells. The onboard equipment is installed inside the instrument module as well on the outer surface of the top tray. The top tray of the microsatellite is nadir-pointing during nominal operations.</p>
<p>The top tray is equipped with attitude control system devices, in particular, magnetometer and diagonal balancing booms, communication antennas and research equipment including three Earth sensors to receive data on the Earth?s planetary emission within infrared wavelength. In addition, spatio-temporal observations of Earth's atmosphere are being conducted within the visible range.</p>
<p>The bottom tray of the spacecraft contains a deployable gravity gradient boom to provide passive stabilization to the satellite. The tip mass of the boom contains a magnetometer. In addition, bottom tray features the navigation antenna, experimental sun sensors, and the RADEK payload.</p>
