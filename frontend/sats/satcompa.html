<p>COMPASS-1 is a CubeSat imaging project of the University of Applied Science at Aachen, Germany (FH Aachen) - initiated in late of 2003 by a team of eight students taking an astronautical engineering course (the COMPASS team includes students of several engineering departments and also faculty members).</p>
<p>The motivation was (and still is) to gain experience and a fresh approach into all aspects of spacecraft system engineering and operations, i.e. to put the lectures into real-world practice.</p>
<p>The CubeSat concept represented a feasible and economical approach in this venture, using COTS (Commercial-of-the-shelf) components wherever possible. Also, the mission objective was set on remote sensing demonstrations because such a type of mission tolerates more lenient pointing requirements on the picosatellite attitude control, as well as on the availability of communication and power supply services</p>
<p>The picosatellite employs the standard CubeSat structure of size 10 cm x 10 cm 10 cm with a mass of < 1 kg. The structure is highly modular for easy assembly.</p>
<p>Of particular importance are the mechanisms to deploy the UHF/VHF antennas after deployment and to close/open the power circuit of the satellite.</p>
<p>The spacecraft is 3-axis stabilized. The ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem) is using active magnetic coils for attitude control.</p>
<p>The spacecraft's attitude is derived from measurements of the suns' position and the instantaneous geomagnetic flux density. This attitude information is then fed into a regulator which drives a set of three mutually perpendicular electromagnetic coils. These magnetorquers generate a magnetic dipole which interacts with the geomagnetic field to produce the control torque necessary to maintain the satellite's nominal nadir alignment.</p>
<p>The measurement of the local magnetic field vector is being done with magnetometers using the HMC6352 digital compass developed and distributed by Honeywell. The sun sensors employ MOEMS (Micro-Opto-Electro-Mechanical System) technology; they have been developed at DTU (Denmark Technical University).
