<p><b>COSMOS 2499 "Fighter satellites"</b></p>
<p>The story began May 23, 2014 at 09:27 (MSK) when a launcher platform number 3 number 133 state test cosmodrome Plesetsk combat crew Forces aerospace defense successfully, the launch of a space rocket light class "Rokot" with block military spacecraft.</p> 
<p>In the estimated time - 11:12 (MSK) spacecraft was successfully launched into the target orbit and taken to manage the means of ground automated control of the Defense Ministry.</p> 
<p>After launching into orbit spacecraft assigned serial numbers 'COSMOS-2496', 'COSMOS-2497', 'COSMOS-2498'. Not far from them Western experts found another object. Initially, this facility was classified as "space junk" put into orbit in May Russian rocket, which was launched in order to add three additional communications satellite "Spring" to the existing military grouping.</p> 
<p>That's all calmed down. And suddenly "space debris" (The US military, which are now watching him, he was given the number 39765 on the classification of NORAD (object 2014-028E)) began to make the direction of movement with respect to Russian vehicles.</p>                                             
<p>The first evidence of orbital changes were seen in the period 29-31 May 2014, when 2014-028E less than a kilometer changed the height of its orbit.</p> 
<p>Repeated changes recorded June 24, 2014, while the perigee decreased by 4 km, apogee rose to 3.5 km.</p> 
<p>During subsequent maneuvers object came suspiciously close to fly in space upper stage "Briz-KM", which led him to other satellites into orbit in May.</p> 
<p>In the following months 2014-028E continued to maneuver, and in late October the US military reclassified it from "debris" in the "payload", start checking the elements of its orbit for three or four times a day and giving the name of the COSMOS 2499.</p> 
<p>November 8-9, according to the observations, the unit leveled its orbit with the orbit of the same upper stage and walked three kilometers away from the relative speed of 6 m / s. All these maneuvers have led to speculation about what the Russian military experience in space new weapons, technology convergence, repair or refueling satellites.</p>
<p>Some even tied orbital maneuvers apparatus with the revival of the Soviet program "Fighter satellites", which allows to destroy enemy spacecraft directed blast. This program was phased out in the early 1990s.</p> 
<p>The whole world is watching Russian spacecraft of unknown destination and fears of the "Fighter of satellites".</p>
<p>Amateur astronomers and observers satellites in Russia and in the West follow the unusual maneuver object 2014-28E. Now and amateurs joined observations:-)</p> 
<p>He may have different functions, some of them civilians, some - the military. In confirmation to the first statement I was today adopted a scientific telemetry signal with COSMOS 2499 on frequencies 435.465 MHz and 435.565 MHz. The first time a strange signal that I could not identify, I noticed in the summer during the reception of satellite TABLETSAT-AURORA.</p> 
<p>In the picture once again screenshot summer, found in the repository at:-) On it you can see 2 data link with COSMOS 2499 (as I now know) and the lighthouse TABLETSAT-AURORA. A lot of time spent on the search for the source. First time I have access to the signal height of the object identified approximately 1500 km, calculate the approximate TLE based on my observations and this led me to the COSMOS 2499.  We are waiting for further developments.</p>
