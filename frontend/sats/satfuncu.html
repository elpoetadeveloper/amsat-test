<p>FUNcube-1, also known as AO-73, is a 1U cubesat (10cm x 10cm x 10cm) built and launched as a collaborative effort between AMSAT-UK, AMSAT-NL, and ISIS-BV.</p>
<p>Launched November 21st, 2013 on a Dnepr rocket, AO-73 was placed in a 682 x 595 km sun-synchronous orbit, inclined 97.8 degrees.</p>
<p>The primary function of the satellite is educational outreach, utilizing onboard experiments, an easy-to-copy 1200 baud BPSK beacon, an innovative SDR receiver (the FUNcube Dongle), and telemetry decoding, archiving, and display program (FUNcube Dashboard). While in eclipse the beacon reduces power, and a 20 kHz U/V transponder is activated.</p>
<p>FUNCube-1 has applied for and been granted AMSAT Oscar 73 (AO-73).</p>
<p>After a brief periood of testing, AO-73 has been switched to autonomous mode, where the educational beacon runs at 300mw while the spacecraft is illuminated. During eclipse, the beacon runs at low power, and the mode U/V transponder is activated. (If any part of the footprint of the satellite includes a sunlit area, the satellite is illuminated. When the entire footprint is dark, the satellite is eclipsed)</p>
<p>Reports are in that many QSOs have been made, with generally strong signals. It should be noted that until Keplerian elements stabilize, full Doppler CAT tuning may not be very successful. When tuning manually the convention is to tune the higher of the two frequencies, in this case the uplink.</p>
