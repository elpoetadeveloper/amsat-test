<p>Originally XI-V is a backup model of XI-IV, and there has been no plan to launch it. 
However XI-IV was so successful, and a propose has come to verify the new type of solar cells with XI-V. 
Launch of XI-V was determined on very short notice. Receiving this chance, we improved the on-board software, and the images taken by XI-V will become more vivid and beautiful.</p> 
<p>Though XI-V is a kid brother of XI-IV, it can be said that he is a souped-up young. XI-V was launched on October 27, 2005, from Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia. 
The launching vehicle was 'KOSMOS' rocket. XI-V was released from ESA's educational satellite SSETI-Express. SSETI-Express itself is a piggy-back satellite, which means that XI-V is a grandchild satellite. 
The specification of XI-V communication system is almost the same as XI-IV. Note that the call sign and frequencies of XI-V are different</p>
