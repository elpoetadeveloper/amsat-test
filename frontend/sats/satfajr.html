<p>Nico Janssen PA0DLO reports that the Iranian Fajr satellite has an amateur radio band telemetry downlink on 437.538 MHz and a command uplink in the 144-146 MHz amateur radio band, also carries a camera for Earth observations.</p>
<p>The Iranian satellite Fajr or 'Dawn' was launched on February 2, 2015 at 0850 UT from the Imam Khomeini Space Center which is south of Semnan in the northern part of the Dasht-e-Kavir desert.</p>
<p>The 50 kg satellite was carried on a Safir launcher into an initial orbit of 223 km by 470 km with an inclination of 55.5 degrees and has been given an object ID of 2015-006A 40387.</p>
<p>It is Iran's fourth satellite and has propulsion in the form of a cold gas thruster. Presumably the thruster will be used to circularize the orbit at around 470 km which may give it a lifetime of over a year.</p>
<p>FAJR is the new generation of Omid (Hope) satellite, which was designed and manufactured by Iranian experts in 2009.</p> 
<p>According to IRNA news agency, the satellite was locally made, as was its launcher.</p> 
<p>Fajr is capable of staying in the space for 1.5 years and taking and transmitting high-quality and accurate pictures to stations on Earth.</p> 
<p>The orbiter is technically characterized by an orbit which could promote from 250 to 450 kilometers through a thruster or an engine.</p> 
<p>Equipped with GPS navigation system, Fajr is the fourth Iranian-made satellite which was put into orbit after three others between 2009 and 2012.</p>
